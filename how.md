# The Philosophy

• Communication is paramount. Delivering complex software solutions requires open and honest communication to resolve problems and mitigate risk.

• Invest in future proofing. Correct architecture provides solutions with longevity that provides a solid backbone with ongoing flexibility to assist with changing requirements.

• Reputation is everything. Marketing can lift your profile, but endorsement is about satisfied clients.

• Done means in production. Testing is important, but the real test is user engagement post deployment. Early deployment brings forward ROI.

• Prefer Open Source. Open source products reduce costs, are arguably more secure, and avoid ‘vendor lock-in'.

# The Mesh

• Collectively we have over 30-years software engineering experience. Check out the Mesh on LinkedIn.

# The Tech

• DLTx leverages the power of industry-standard programming languages such as C#, Python, NodeJS, React, Swift and more.

• Back-end controllers will usually be written in NodeJS which, simply put, executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.
It is an open source and highly performant JavaScript runtime environment used by industry giants such as Netflix, eBay,
Uber and LinkedIn.

• Front-end will be delivered in the modern JavaScript framework “React” (developed by Facebook). React Native is used to
develop native iOS and Android apps in parallel, reducing delivery times and minimising outlay.

• Digital Ocean is preferred for hosting, providing excellent uptime and pricing structure. Alternatively, the solution can
be deployed on services such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS and Heroku.

# The Build

DLTx is a strict Agile software house that encourages Client/Stakeholder participation in the build process. A collaborative approach improves results by reducing waste, assumptions and expense.

• Work is boxed into two-week Sprints, ensuring all Stakeholders understand the deliverables. A straightforward list of outcomes allows a mutual committment to delivery by all involved.

• Deeper understanding of the product is gained through Client/Stakeholder attendance at the sprint planning meetings where requirements are transformed into discrete, outcome-centric units of work called 'User Stories'.

• Stakeholders are encouraged to join the daily Stand-up Meetings (usually 10:00AM-10:15AM) either in-person or via ZOOM. Team members share their progress, concerns or potential blockers, which allows Project Leads to react immediately. This ceremony provide developers with product or business information without delay.

• Jira is a flexible and powerful tool used to track workflow and provide overview via reporting. Team members self-assign work, usually choosing the task best suited to their competencies. Stakeholders are encouraged to use their access to monitor velocity, burn down and other metrics along with the progress of each individual User Story.

# The IP

• All artefacts, code, scripts, images, etc are delivered at the end of each sprint via GitHub or similar. Not only does this safeguard your investment, it allows immediate and direct collaboration with Client's in-house or external dev teams.

• GitHub (recently acquired by Microsoft for $7.5 billion in stock) is the leading code repository.

• Terms and conditions secure your IP. Code cannot be re-used elsewhere without express permission and acknowledgement.

## Done Means In Production!

**The Opportunity**

Based on our discussions, we understand the opportunity to:
Provide architectural advice, Business Analysis and development services in producing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a .... platform that will ...

# The Solution

**Workshop**

DLTx will conduct a half-day workshop, drawing on the proponent’s ideas and is aimed at producing a basic Story Map which will in turn be used to generate the User Stories for eventual production. The Workshop will be conducted on-site at dltx and be facilitated by a Business Analyst (BA), with additional input from a Senior Developer and other team members as required.

A written report summarising the Workshop outcomes will be provided. The report will: 

1. Clarify additional contributions required from Subject Matter Experts
2. Identify needs for further technical research in terms of production
3. Provide a broad understanding of relevant compliance and regulatory issues
4. Allow the participant/s to consider the how the proposed project fits with their business model

**User stories**

The Business Analyst will develop User Stories,reflecting the Workshop outcomes and in accordance with the INVEST criteria.
* Indpendent
* Negotiable
* Valuable
* Estimatable
* Small
* Testable
 
**Sprint**

The Development Team will undertake the work invoked by the User Stories over a two-week Sprint and provide a Showcase of the outcomes for all stakeholders at the conclusion.

**Workshop, BA and Development will usually take place over 3-4 weeks, including the two-week production sprint.**

# Investment

**Workshop**

On acceptance of this proposal, dltx will invoice for $750 to provide the Workshop and report described above. This is the only commitment required at this point. This cost will be deducted from costs described below when the project	proceeds to production. 
  
**Production**

It is estimated that creation of the User Stories in addition to a two-week sprint will require the following effort:

### EXAMPLE

| __Resource__ | __Day Rate__ | __Effort__ | __Cost__ |
|-------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Senior Developer - Consultancy, Architecture, Dev Team Lead                          | $1,500 |  2  | $ 3,000 |
| Developer - API Development, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Backend coding                     | $  800 | 10  | $ 8,000 |
| Business Analyst - Requirements gathering, documentation, Project Management         | $1,000 | 1.5 | $ 1,500 |
|Subtotal                                                                                       |     | $12,500 |
|GST %                                                                                          | 10  | $ 1,250 |
|Total (inc gst)                                                                                |     | $13,750 |
