# Venture Studio

DLTx is open to partnerships with blockchain and payment-based start-ups.  For nascent start-ups or those interested in exploring joint ventures, this is our typical process:

## Block 0
Starting with a 30-minute informal meeting (in our George St, Brisbane office or via Zoom) allows us to talk through the idea in technical and commercial terms. Understanding the founderâ€™s aspirations and goals is vital in ensuring their vision aligns with DLTx.

## Block 1
Assuming there is a mutual appetite to explore a POC or MVP, the next step is a half-day workshop with guidance from a Business Analyst, Tech Lead and Design Lead. The object is to explore what the product could look like, both in terms of MVP/POC and V1.0, along with defining what 'success' is.  The cost is typically $1,500+ GST (which is then offset against the cost of any further work should the project proceed).

## Block 2
As an artifact of Block 1, a proposal containing an estimate of effort and a summary of opportunity and prospective solution will be provided. The proposal may also explore possibilities for discounts and/or equity-based participation, based on the conversations thus far.  Equity participation can vary between 0% to 49% dependant on an evaluation of the opportunity and the perceived ability of the founders to execute commercially.

## Block 3
The build.  A typical MVP/POC projects cost $10,000 to $50,000 plus GST.  A summary of DLTx's methodology and values can be found at https://github.com/dltxio/dltxio.github.io/blob/master/how.md
